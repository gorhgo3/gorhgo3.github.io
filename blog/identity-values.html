      <div class="blog-content">
        <h4></h4>
        <p>
          I used to work at a well-respected university, and during a
          mid-semester break, we had construction work happening in a section of
          the campus to avoid disrupting students. On this one particular day
          while working nearby, despite the construction site being off-limits,
          I suddenly heard jackhammers and noise come to a halt. It turned out
          that a worker had made a disrespectful remark to a young female
          student who happened to be the only student on campus at that time,
          and all the rest joined in.
          <br />
          This incident struck a chord with me because such behavior was
          unfortunately not uncommon in the construction industry, and I'd often
          shrugged it off in the past when in a workshop. But this time, it felt
          like a significant breach of ethics, especially considering that a
          university campus should be a safe place for students to walk around.
          <br />
          I made the decision to report the incident to the project management,
          even though my colleagues didn't see it as a major issue. As a result
          of my report, one worker was removed from the construction site.
          Looking back, I'm still conflicted because I may have contributed to
          someone losing their job. However, I couldn't ignore the fact that
          this incident crossed a line for me.
          <br />
          In hindsight, I wonder if there could have been a better way to handle
          the situation, but I acted based on my strong belief that certain
          boundaries should not be crossed, especially not in what should be a
          safe place for a lone female student.

        <h4>Values and identity.</h4>
        <p>
          My culture and the people around me have played a significant role in
          shaping my values and identity. Growing up in a divided family
          environment taught me self-reliance and resilience. The workshop
          culture I was exposed to during my formative years emphasized humor
          and camaraderie alongside competitive comparisons.
          <br />
          This environment initially led to self-criticism and a relentless
          pursuit of self-improvement. However, as I matured, I realized the
          importance of empathy and breaking free from the notion that my worth
          was tied to any particular thing. This shift in values was influenced
          by the evolving perspectives of the people I encountered in my life.
          <br />
          One notable aspect of my evolving identity has been redifining what
          self-improvement looks like for me. Most recently I've been focused on
          applying a positive internal dialogue during challenging times,
          promoting patience and self-acceptance. This for me has been a slow
          evolution- which ultimately led me to looking for a change of career.

        My Strengths
      </h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <p>
          I have a strong aptitude for fault-finding. While I may not always
          understand the technical intricacies of an issue, I excel at
          identifying abnormalities and anomalies. I genuinely enjoy reverse
          engineering problems, which has proven instrumental in overcoming
          challenges and comprehending complex concepts.

        My limitations in my learning and career
        development.
      </h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <p>
          It's important to acknowledge my limitations as I embark on my
          learning and career development journey. One of my perceived
          limitations lies in my information processing speed, particularly
          concerning technical concepts in the tech industry. I've noticed
          instances where I took longer to grasp certain ideas compared to my
          peers, which can be concerning given the fast-paced nature of the
          field.
          <br />
        <h4>How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
          This could potentially impact my ability to quickly understand coding
          and programming concepts, which might require more time and effort on
          my part. It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that I might not
          keep up as efficiently as others.
          <br />
          Furthermore, there's a tendency to let these limitations define my
          self-image. If I sense that others perceive me as struggling, it could
          lead to feelings of awkwardness or self-doubt in social interactions.
          <br />
          While I'm mindful of my limitations, I'm also open to the possibility
          that my assumptions could be flawed. I intend to leverage my
          strengths, seek assistance when needed, and maintain a growth-oriented
          mindset. By addressing my limitations constructively, I can approach
          my learning journey with determination and adaptability, ultimately
          driving my own progress.

        When were you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension.
      </h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <p>
          In a previous job, I faced resistance while implementing a Building
          Management Systems (BMS) project due to miscommunication. We initially
          addressed these issues through meetings, but I soon realized that
          improved communication was essential.
          <br />
          One key reason for the resistance was that our team didn't have a
          clear idea of the full potential scope we could be working with. To
          address this, I built a strong rapport with a BMS manager and engaged
          in discussions to better understand the project's scope. This allowed
          us to anticipate roadblocks and find solutions, reducing conflicts.
          <br />
          Reflecting on this experience, I see that clear communication is
          vital. In the future, I'd be more proactive in meetings by asking the
          right questions for a comprehensive understanding. I'd also encourage
          team members to voice concerns, emphasizing the importance of sharing
          perspectives.
          <br />
          Overall, this experience highlighted the significance of communication
          in productive collaborations. While I managed the situation well, I
          now recognize that enhanced communication from the start could have
          prevented some of the resistance and tension in the project.
