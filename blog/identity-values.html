      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h1>
    <p>
      I used to work at a well-respected university, and during a mid-semester
      break, we had construction work happening in a section of the campus to
      avoid disrupting students. On this one particular day while working
      nearby, despite the construction site being off-limits, I suddenly heard
      jackhammers and noise come to a halt. It turned out that a worker had made
      a disrespectful remark to a young female student who happened to be the
      only person on campus at the time, and all the rest joined in.
      <br />
      This incident struck a chord with me because such behavior was
      unfortunately not uncommon in the construction industry, and I'd often
      shrugged it off in the past when in a workshop. But this time, it felt
      like a significant breach of ethics, especially considering that a
      university campus should be a safe place for students to walk around.
      <br />
      I made the decision to report the incident to the project management, even
      though my colleagues didn't see it as a major issue. As a result of my
      report, one worker was removed from the construction site. Looking back,
      I'm still conflicted because I may have contributed to someone losing
      their job. However, I couldn't ignore the fact that this incident crossed
      a line for me.
      <br />
      In hindsight, I wonder if there could have been a better way to handle the
      situation, but I acted based on my strong belief that certain boundaries
      should not be crossed, especially not in what should be a safe place for a
      lone female student.

      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h1>

    <p>
      My culture and the people around me have played a significant role in
      shaping my values and identity. Growing up in a divided family environment
      taught me self-reliance and resilience. The workshop culture I was exposed
      to during my formative years emphasized humor and camaraderie alongside
      competitive comparisons.
      <br />
      This environment initially led to self-criticism and a relentless pursuit
      of self-improvement. However, as I matured, I realized the importance of
      empathy and breaking free from the notion that my worth was tied to any
      particular thing. This shift in values was influenced by the evolving
      perspectives of the people I encountered in my life.
      <br />
      One notable aspect of my evolving identity has been redifining what
      self-improvement looks like for me. Most recently I've been focused on
      applying a positive internal dialogue during challenging times, promoting
      patience and self-acceptance. This for me has been a slow evolution- which
      ultimately led me to looking for a change of career.

      I have a strong aptitude for fault-finding. While I may not always
      understand the technical intricacies of an issue, I excel at identifying
      abnormalities and anomalies. I genuinely enjoy reverse engineering
      problems, which has proven instrumental in overcoming challenges and
      comprehending complex concepts.

      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h1>
    <p>
      It's important to acknowledge my limitations as I embark on my learning
      and career development journey. One of my perceived limitations lies in my
      information processing speed, particularly concerning technical concepts
      in the tech industry. I've noticed instances where I took longer to grasp
      certain ideas compared to my peers, which can be concerning given the
      fast-paced nature of the field.
      <br />
      This could potentially impact my ability to quickly understand coding and
      programming concepts, which might require more time and effort on my part.
      It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that I might not keep up as
      efficiently as others.
      <br />
      Furthermore, there's a tendency to let these limitations define my
      self-image. If I sense that others perceive me as struggling, it could
      lead to feelings of awkwardness or self-doubt in social interactions.
      <br />
      While I'm mindful of my limitations, I'm also open to the possibility that
      my assumptions could be flawed. I intend to leverage my strengths, seek
      assistance when needed, and maintain a growth-oriented mindset. By
      addressing my limitations constructively, I can approach my learning
      journey with determination and adaptability, ultimately driving my own
      progress.

      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h1>
    <p>
      In a previous job, I faced resistance while implementing a Building
      Management Systems (BMS) project due to miscommunication. We initially
      addressed these issues through meetings, but I soon realized that improved
      communication was essential.
      <br />
      One key reason for the resistance was that our team didn't have a clear
      idea of the full potential scope we could be working with. To address
      this, I built a strong rapport with a BMS manager and engaged in
      discussions to better understand the project's scope. This allowed us to
      anticipate roadblocks and find solutions, reducing conflicts.
      <br />
      Reflecting on this experience, I see that clear communication is vital. In
      the future, I'd be more proactive in meetings by asking the right
      questions for a comprehensive understanding. I'd also encourage team
      members to voice concerns, emphasizing the importance of sharing
      perspectives.
      <br />
      Overall, this experience highlighted the significance of communication in
      productive collaborations. While I managed the situation well, I now
      recognize that enhanced communication from the start could have prevented
      some of the resistance and tension in the project.
