          My primary objective is to consistently attend the gym at least three
          times a week. Recognizing and respecting my body's limits,
          particularly during bouldering, is crucial. Should I feel any
          discomfort or potential injury, especially in my fingers, I commit to
          prioritizing safety over performance and taking a step back. This
          strategy not only helps prevent overexertion but also significantly
          reduces the risk of serious injuries. More than just performance
          metrics, I aim to focus on the quality and intent behind each workout,
          ensuring both a healthy body and a clear mind.

          Embracing the present moment is at the heart of my aspirations. Lately
          I have been letting some of the relationships with others slip. I wish
          to reinforce my appreciation for them by cherishing every moment with
          my loved ones and friends and actively seeking deeper conversations.
          These are the bonds upon which I've built my life, and which I hold
          dear. By actively nurturing these relationships, I hope to cultivate
          an even greater appreciation for those in my life.

          As someone who has grappled with mental health challenges, my
          commitment remains to continuously engage with my inner self. I aim to
          practice self-empathy daily, recognizing both my strengths and
          vulnerabilities. Incorporating daily gratitude allows me to deepen my
          understanding of myself and gives me the grace to accept that it's
          okay not to always feel at my best.

          Once a week, I will intentionally reflect and remind myself that my
          worth is not tied to anyone else's perception or the output I produce.
          My value is intrinsic, and I will nurture that belief.

          I am invested in committing to bolstering my self-awareness and
          understanding of my own identity. Central to this journey are the
          practices of gratitude and empathy. I intend to set aside dedicated
          time and resources to nurture this spiritual growth, ensuring that I
          remain in tune with my inner self and the world around me.

          I am making a conscious commitment to step outside daily during my
          study sessions, without any specific agenda. The simple act of feeling
          the wind, listening to the trees, or distant hum of the streets have a
          grounding effect. I've realized that I often miss the beauty of good
          weather by being absorbed in study. Therefore, I aim to prioritize
          short breaks, especially when the sun is out. As this not only
          connects me to nature but also brings the added benefit of soaking in
          some vitamin D from the sunshine.
