        <h4>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I realized the importance of shifting from a competitive mindset to
          one where I find inspiration in others' achievements rather than
          feeling inadequate. <br />

          I tend to internalize feedback from others, sometimes turning it into
          self-doubt. I'm open to being inspired by others but struggle when
          their success is presented as a challenge to my own progress. <br />

          I've observed that I can be overly self-critical and tend to live in
          my head, especially in group settings, which has become more evident
          during core learning.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Empathy and Self-Awareness: Empathy and self-awareness play crucial
          roles in my learning and programming journey. They help me recognize
          when I'm mentally fatigued and struggling to learn efficiently. It's
          essential to be empathetic to myself during such times, acknowledging
          that stress and time constraints can affect my performance. This
          self-compassion ensures a healthier learning approach. Learning from
          Others: In programming, I've learned that everyone has their unique
          problem-solving approach. Reviewing others' code provides insight into
          their thought process. It's common to feel intimidated, especially
          when my code seems messy. However, I've embraced the idea that
          inspiration can come from unexpected places, even in seemingly poorly
          written code. This openness to learning from others has been valuable.
        </p>
        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          Core learning is not something typically associated with coding, and I
          initially thought it might be irrelevant. I found a few key takeaways
          that resonated with me though. One of them was the concept of
          neuroplasticity and the importance of recognizing fixed and growth
          mindsets. Understanding this not only benefits my learning but also my
          mental well-being. <br />

          What stuck with me the most was how some individuals with a fixed
          mindset felt the need to constantly justify themselves and prove their
          worth to the world. In contrast, those with a growth mindset are
          comfortable with themselves and open to being inspired by others. This
          perspective, especially illustrated through case studies with school
          children, was a valuable takeaway from the core learning.
        </p>
        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          The most challenging part of the core learning was staying motivated
          during sections that I didn't feel particularly invested in. Some
          parts felt less relevant to my coding journey, and I questioned if my
          time could be better spent coding. During the first and second sprint,
          when there was a lot of core content, I found it difficult to stay
          engaged. It's a common experience that not every piece of advice
          resonates with everyone. I've worked on personal growth throughout my
          20s, and certain core concepts align more closely with my experiences,
          while others felt less applicable.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I believe the emphasis on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course is crucial. In the tech industry, which is fast-paced and
          competitive, having soft skills and a well-rounded mindset is
          essential. It sets candidates apart from the crowd and makes them
          appealing to employers. <br />

          Breaking down problems and fault-finding are valuable skills. The
          ability to retain knowledge, keep an open mind, and maintain a strong
          sense of self is beneficial. Core learning assists in fostering this
          mindset. <br />

          No matter how skilled one is in technical aspects like JavaScript,
          CSS, or HTML, there will always be others who are faster or smarter.
          Recognizing that everyone brings unique strengths and experiences to
          the table is a key takeaway. It's about what you can offer as a team
          member who acknowledges both flaws and strengths.

        <h4>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h4>

        <p>
          While I found some sections of the core to be excessive, I understand
          its purpose. The core learning accommodates a diverse group of
          learners, and not everything will resonate with everyone. It ensures
          that everyone has something to reflect upon and learn from.
          Personally, I believe I could have spent less time on certain core
          elements, but the parts I resonated with were valuable and have stuck
          with me. I don't think it was a waste of time, as it provided a
          well-rounded learning experience.
