        <h4>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I've recognized the importance of shifting from a competitive mindset
          to finding inspiration in others' achievements rather than feeling
          inadequate. <br />

          I tend to internalize feedback from others, sometimes turning it into
          self-doubt. While I'm open to being inspired by others, I can struggle
          with poorly presented feedback, which is an area I need to work on.
          <br />

          I've realized that I am a visual person when communicating with
          others. I derive comfort from seeing the person I am conversing with
          for visual feedback, and has become more apparent during core
          learning.

        <h4>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Values, empathy, and self-awareness are crucial in both learning and
          programming. They help me recognize mental fatigue and stress,
          fostering a healthier learning approach. Moreover, in programming,
          I've learned that everyone has a unique problem-solving approach, and
          even in poorly written code, there can be valuable lessons.
          <br />
          I remember watching a 'worst movies with genius scenes' countdown- and
          I remember that even in a bomb there can be sections of beautiful
          code- logic or presentation.
        </p>
        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          I was surprised by the relevance of core learning to coding. While I
          initially thought it might be unrelated, I found valuable insights.
          Neuroplasticity and the fixed vs. growth mindset concept were
          particularly enlightening. Learning how individuals with a fixed
          mindset felt compelled to prove themselves, while those with a growth
          mindset embraced inspiration, left a lasting impression.
        </p>
        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          The most challenging part was staying motivated in sections I didn't
          find relevant. Some parts felt disconnected from my coding journey,
          leading me to question whether coding practice would be more
          beneficial. The extensive core content during the first and second
          sprint made it challenging to stay engaged. Not all advice resonates
          with everyone, and some core concepts aligned better with my
          experiences than others.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I believe EDA places a strong emphasis on core learning because of the
          fast-paced and competitive nature of the tech industry. My
          understanding is that there will always be individuals with
          exceptional technical skills. EDA encourages us to recognize the
          unique strengths and skills we bring from our previous careers and
          lives. This approach helps us market ourselves effectively, not just
          based on technical skills, but also on our interpersonal abilities and
          our capacity to learn and adapt. <br />

          EDA is assisting us to understand that what makes us
          valuable to the industry is not necessarily going to be our technical
          skills after 3 months; rather, it will be our capacity to understand
          that our valuable skills have already been worked on over the course
          of our lives and careers to this point.

        <h4>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h4>
        <p>
          While some core sections felt excessive, I understand EDA's purpose in
          accommodating for diverse learners. Not everything resonates with
          everyone, but it ensures everyone has something to learn from. <br />
          Personally, I could have spent less time on certain core elements, but
          the valuable parts have stuck with me. Overall, I dont think it was a
          waste of time- I believe core concepts will assist me further down the
          road, and I'm aware that there will be a big learning process beyond
          EDA. Which this seems to be preparing us for when we encounter self
          doubt.
