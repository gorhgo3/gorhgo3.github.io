    <h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to be settled and happy in a job and career where I
      can see a future. Web Development is an experimental period, and I'm not
      sure if it will be my lifelong career. However, I do want to end up in the
      tech industry. I am currently exploring different aspects of tech to
      determine where I fit best. In summary, my long-term goal is to be happy,
      have potential for career development, and I believe that lies in software
      development or possibly the backend of web development, as frontend work
      doesn't hold my attention for extended periods. I enjoy optimizing and
      identifying inefficiencies, which I believe could be valuable in gaming,
      software development, or backend work within a full-stack application.

    <h3>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I may have some form of dyslexia, which makes it challenging to grasp
      certain concepts quickly. I learn best through verbal communication rather
      than reading. Videos are more effective for me than written documents. My
      attention span is short, but I can focus for hours on topics that
      genuinely excite me. This can be both a strength and a weakness because my
      ability to absorb information is directly related to my interest in the
      subject. I'm concerned that I may not absorb information as efficiently as
      others in the tech industry, which places a high value on rapid learning
      and adaptability.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I would like to develop my confidence, particularly in communication. I
      find it nerve-wracking to interact with others, especially in virtual
      settings where it feels more formal and lacks personal feedback. I've
      noticed that I'm more at ease in face-to-face interactions and want to
      bridge this gap. I believe that improving my confidence in remote
      communication will be crucial for success in the program.
    </p>
    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program:</h3>
    <p>
      I commit to being punctual and adhering to a structured learning routine.
      I will hold myself accountable for starting work by 8:30 in the morning to
      establish a productive day. Scheduled breaks will allow me to recharge and
      maintain focus throughout the day. Regarding working with others, I will
      strive to be available to my classmates and actively engage in
      collaborative efforts when needed. Communication will be a priority,
      ensuring my peers are aware of my progress and challenges.
    </p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</h3>
    <p>
      I expect the Facilitation team to be available during working hours to
      address issues related to coursework or any challenges that may arise.
      Having their support and guidance readily accessible is crucial for my
      success in the program.
    </p>
    <h3>Any scheduling information:</h3>
    <p>
      I do not have any commitments that require my immediate attention.
      However, I recognize the importance of taking breaks to maintain
      productivity. Planning my day to prioritize more demanding tasks in the
      morning and less mentally taxing work in the afternoon aligns with my
      background in trades and helps me stay productive. Recharging during
      breaks will be essential for me to produce high-quality work throughout
      the day.
