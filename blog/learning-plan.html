        <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          Well, my long-term goal hasn't really changed much. I'm aiming to
          eventually dive into the world of backend or software development.
          Right now, I'm hoping to kickstart my journey through web development
          and secure a job in that field. Gradually, I plan to make the shift to
          backend development. I've realized I'm in my element on some of the
          more technical aspects of web development, and can stay focused for
          longer when I'm coding. So I think thats a good track to go down.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h4>
        <p>
          In Bootcamp, I believe my biggest strengths will include: <br />
          Engagement with Interesting Content: I tend to stay highly engaged and
          absorb information efficiently when I find the content interesting and
          relevant to what I'm working on. <br />

          Technical Proficiency: I feel confident in my technical abilities and
          enjoy working on the technical aspects of coding. <br />

          However, I also recognize some limitations: <br />
          Attention Span: My attention span tends to be directly correlated with
          how engaged I am with the content, which can be a challenge when
          facing less engaging material. <br />

          Verbal Learning vs. Reading: I find reading and comprehending abstract
          or challenging concepts in text documents to be tedious, which may
          pose a challenge when dealing with complex written documentation or
          instructions. <br />

          Risk of Losing Interest: If I encounter topics or exercises that I
          don't find particularly interesting, I might invest more time in
          researching them, potentially slowing down my progress. <br />

          In summary, my strengths lie in my engagement with interesting
          content, technical proficiency, and collaboration skills. However, I
          need to be mindful of my attention span, potential struggles with
          abstract or less engaging material, and the risk of losing interest in
          certain topics.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Public speaking has always made me feel anxious, and the thought of it
          is quite terrifying. While I would like to improve my confidence in
          speaking to a group and giving presentations, it's a significant
          challenge for me. This aspect of the boot camp, working on
          presentation skills and becoming more comfortable with speaking, is
          what I anticipate to be my biggest non-technical challenge.
        </p>
        <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
        <p>
          My expectations of myself during Bootcamp are to fully engage in the
          learning journey, regardless of my personal preferences or desires. I
          recognize that sometimes the most valuable learning happens when I
          step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself. I expect myself to
          be open to various learning methods and to make the most of the
          supportive environment provided by the program. <br />
        </p>
        <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
        <p>
          My expectations of myself during Bootcamp are centered around a
          proactive and engaged approach to learning. I am committed to getting
          the most out of each lesson. That means taking personal responsibility
          for my learning and seeking additional resources or context when
          necessary. <br />

          In a group setting with coordinators and instructors, I expect myself
          to actively participate by asking questions and seeking insights,
          especially when it comes to industry standards and practical
          knowledge. I understand the importance of learning from experienced
          professionals rather than relying solely on generic or potentially
          outdated sources. <br />

          I also acknowledge the potential time constraints and pressure that
          may arise during Bootcamp, but I intend to make the most of the
          resources available, including the support of coordinators and
          managers. My goal is to use my time efficiently and effectively and to
          collaborate with others in a meaningful way.
          <br />

          Overall, my expectations for myself on Bootcamp revolve around a
          proactive, resourceful, and collaborative approach to learning and
          personal development.

      <div class="blog-content">
        <h4>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to be happy, have potential for career
          development, and I believe that lies in software development or
          possibly the backend of web development, sometimes the appeal of
          frontend can be lost on me with certain aspects . While I know I enjoy
          optimizing and identifying inefficiencies, which I believe could be
          valuable in gaming, software development, or backend work within a
          full-stack application.
        </p>
        <h4>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning:
        </h4>
        <p>
          I sometimes find it challenging to grasp certain concepts quickly. I
          learn best through verbal communication rather than reading, where
          often times videos are more effective for me than written documents. I
          can focus for hours on topics that genuinely excite me, however with
          those that don't it can be a tedious task to research. This can be
          both a strength and a weakness because my ability to absorb
          information seems to be directly related to my interest in the
          subject. I'm concerned that I may not absorb information as
          efficiently as others in the tech industry, which places a high value
          on rapid learning and adaptability.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I would like to develop my confidence, particularly in communication.
          I find it nerve-wracking to interact with others, especially in
          virtual settings where it feels more formal and lacks personal
          feedback. I've noticed that I'm more at ease in face-to-face
          interactions and want to bridge this gap. I believe that improving my
          confidence in remote communication will be crucial for success in the
          program.
        </p>
        <h4>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program:
        </h4>
        <p>
          I commit to being punctual and adhering to a structured learning
          routine. I will hold myself accountable for starting work by 8:30 in
          the morning to establish a productive day. Scheduled breaks will allow
          me to recharge and maintain focus throughout the day. Regarding
          working with others, I will strive to be available to my classmates
          and actively engage in collaborative efforts when needed.
          Communication will be a priority, ensuring my peers are aware of my
          progress and challenges.
        </p>
        <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</h4>
        <p>
          I expect the Facilitation team to be available during working hours to
          address issues related to coursework or any challenges that may arise.
          Having their support and guidance readily accessible is crucial for my
          success in the program.
        </p>
        <h4>Any scheduling information:</h4>
        <p>
          I do not have any commitments that require my immediate attention.
          However, I recognize the importance of taking breaks to maintain
          productivity. Planning my day to prioritize more demanding tasks in
          the morning and less mentally taxing work in the afternoon aligns with
          my background in trades and helps me stay productive. Recharging
          during breaks will be essential for me to produce high-quality work
          throughout the day.
