        <h4>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to be happy, have potential for career
          development, and I believe that lies in software development or
          possibly the backend of web development, sometimes the appeal of
          frontend can be lost on me with certain aspects . While I know I enjoy
          optimizing and identifying inefficiencies, which I believe could be
          valuable in gaming, software development, or backend work within a
          full-stack application.
        </p>
        <h4>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning:
        </h4>
        <p>
          I sometimes find it challenging to grasp certain concepts quickly. I
          learn best through verbal communication rather than reading, where
          often times videos are more effective for me than written documents. I
          can focus for hours on topics that genuinely excite me, however with
          those that don't it can be a tedious task to research. This can be
          both a strength and a weakness because my ability to absorb
          information seems to be directly related to my interest in the
          subject. I'm concerned that I may not absorb information as
          efficiently as others in the tech industry, which places a high value
          on rapid learning and adaptability.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I would like to develop my confidence, particularly in communication.
          I find it nerve-wracking to interact with others, especially in
          virtual settings where it feels more formal and lacks personal
          feedback. I've noticed that I'm more at ease in face-to-face
          interactions and want to bridge this gap. I believe that improving my
          confidence in remote communication will be crucial for success in the
          program.
        </p>
        <h4>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program:
        </h4>
        <p>
          I commit to being punctual and adhering to a structured learning
          routine. I will hold myself accountable for starting work by 8:30 in
          the morning to establish a productive day. Scheduled breaks will allow
          me to recharge and maintain focus throughout the day. Regarding
          working with others, I will strive to be available to my classmates
          and actively engage in collaborative efforts when needed.
          Communication will be a priority, ensuring my peers are aware of my
          progress and challenges.
        </p>
        <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</h4>
        <p>
          I expect the Facilitation team to be available during working hours to
          address issues related to coursework or any challenges that may arise.
          Having their support and guidance readily accessible is crucial for my
          success in the program.
        </p>
        <h4>Any scheduling information:</h4>
        <p>
          I do not have any commitments that require my immediate attention.
          However, I recognize the importance of taking breaks to maintain
          productivity. Planning my day to prioritize more demanding tasks in
          the morning and less mentally taxing work in the afternoon aligns with
          my background in trades and helps me stay productive. Recharging
          during breaks will be essential for me to produce high-quality work
          throughout the day.
