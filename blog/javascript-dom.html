            JavaScript is a versatile scripting language often referred to as the "language of the internet." It plays a crucial role in web and app development by enabling dynamic functionality. One of its standout features is its ability to interact with the browser's Document Object Model (DOM), which is essential for creating dynamic web pages.
        </p>
        
        <h4>JavaScript's Applications</h4>
        
        <p>
            JavaScript stands apart from HTML and CSS due to its unique role in manipulating events and driving dynamic changes within web applications. While it differs significantly from HTML and CSS, these three technologies work together in harmony. Without any one of them, the internet as we know it today would not exist.

            Javascript is a scripting language often considered the language of
            the internet. <br />
            It is versatile and heavily used in web and app development. <br />A
            key feature that sets Javascript apart is its ability to interact
            with the browser DOM which is used in the construction of a dynamic
            web page.
          </p>
          <h4>Javascript uses</h4>
          <p>
            It stands apart from HTML and CSS in the way it is used to
            manipulate and drive events and dynamic changes within its
            environment, there are not many similarities between Javascript and
            the others- however they work in unison. Without any one of these
            the internet would not be the place it is today.

        <h3 class="blog-header">Control-Flow of Javascript</h3>
        <div class="blog-content">
          <h4>first of all, what is "Control-flow"</h4>
          <p>
            "Control flow is thought of as the order in which individual
            startements, instructions or function calls of an impreative program
            are executed or evaluated" <br />In simple terms- if we were to read
            a book we would read it left-right-top-bottom. Coding follows a
            similar principle of operation and logic is performed in a
            sequential order. Javascript is much like reading a book, theres
            nothing special about the natural order in which the script is
            excecuted- left to right, top to bottom.
          </p>
          <h4>Controlling the flow of the script</h4><audio controls autoplay loop muted>
            <source src="cafe.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
          </audio>
          
          <p>
            In Javascript we use control structures to alter the flow of events
            of the application we run. That is, not all the code will be
            activated upon runtime. <br />Instead we use a series of
            conditionals to activate, or prevent sections of our script from
            running. This way we get to customise the operation of the script
            depending on the specific use-case we require at the time. This is
            achieved using control structures such as
            <strong>Conditionals</strong>. <br />another way to put this is that
            essentially when we break down what coding really is, it is a series
            of if/else statments- and a big application is made up of thousands,
            and possibly millions of these conditions. This creates the broader
            scope of what is happening behind the scenes in games, scripting,
            data analysis, and web development (backend). And this needs to be
            achieved someway or another- that is what the conditionals do!

        <h3 class="blog-header">Control Flow in JavaScript</h3>
        <div class="blog-content">
            <h4>First, What is "Control Flow"?</h4>
            <p>
                Control flow refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls in an imperative program are executed or evaluated. <br />In simpler terms, it's like reading a book from left to right, top to bottom. Coding in JavaScript follows a similar sequential logic. There's nothing inherently special about the natural order in which the script is executed.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Managing Script Flow</h4>            
            <p>
                In JavaScript, we use control structures to influence the flow of events in our applications. Not all the code runs at once. Instead, we employ conditionals to selectively activate or prevent sections of our script from running. This customization allows us to adapt the script's behavior to specific use cases. Control structures, such as <strong>conditionals</strong>, play a fundamental role in this process. In essence, coding often boils down to a series of if/else statements, and complex applications consist of thousands or even millions of these conditions. This concept underlies what happens behind the scenes in various domains, including games, scripting, data analysis, and web development (backend).

          <p>Its not literally your fridge; but to liken it to a real like scenario we've all gone through image you wake up one morning and go down to the Kitchen to start the day. A conditional we might find we ask ourselves is <h4>I'm here now, am I hungry?</h4> if the answer is 'no'- we do not prepare breakfast. Then we ask ourselves 'am I thirsty', now we perhaps say yes! in this situation if Javascript were in control of your life- we would gather orange juice from the fridge and ask ourselves 'should we get a cup', or maybe if we have small small orange juice containers we would drink of of the fun-size carton. <h4>But we can notice there are many decisions we make when we arrive in the kitchen</h4> and Javascript needs a way to handle this if it were in control of our morning routine. <br>So there is a requirement here to determine the sorts of actions our application will run based on the feedback it recieves from the user walking around the kitchen (a poor metaphor) but this is just like running a script on a computer! <br>In my example the decision to not make breakfast could have been done with an <strong>IF STATEMENT</strong> if I'm hungry: make breakfast</p>

        <p>
            Programming languages, like your fridge, have different ways of managing the flow of actions. Let's dive into how JavaScript, in particular, handles these "kitchen decisions."
        </p>
    
        <h4>Your Fridge's Control Flow</h4>
    
        <p>
            Imagine your fridge as a JavaScript program. Just like in coding, your fridge makes decisions based on what's inside. Here's how JavaScript's control flow mechanisms relate to your fridge:
        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Logical OR Operator (<strong>||</strong>): It's like checking if there's orange juice or milk. You take the first available option.</li>
            <li>Ternary Operator (<strong>?</strong>): Think of it as deciding between a big glass and a small glass for your juice: <em>condition ? bigGlass : smallGlass</em>.</li>
            <li>if Statement: Just like opening your fridge to check if the milk is expired. If it is, you buy a new one; otherwise, you use what's there.</li>
            <li>else Statement: When the juice is empty, you grab the milk instead. It's your "Plan B."</li>
            <li>Logical AND Operator (<strong>&amp;&amp;</strong>): Imagine needing both milk and eggs to make pancakes. You'll only make them if both items are available.</li>
            <li>Comparison Operators: These are like checking if an item in the fridge is fresh or expired, e.g., <em>if (milk === 'fresh')</em>.</li>
            <li>else if Clause: Sometimes you want pancakes if you have fresh eggs or cereal if you don't. You have multiple options.</li>
            <li>Truthy and Falsy Values: When you check if there's something in the fridge, it can be either "truthy" (yes, there's something) or "falsy" (nope, it's empty).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            In your kitchen (or your code), these control flow mechanisms help you make decisions based on what's in your fridge (or your program's data). Just as you adapt your breakfast choices, your code adapts to different scenarios, making it as versatile as your morning routine.

        <!-- Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. -->
        
        <h3 class="blog-header">Javascript Arrays and Objects</h3>
        <div class="blog-content">
          <p>
            Both JavaScript arrays and objects can be thought of as containers, each with their own methods and operators unique to their respective elements. Objects can be considered as variables that contain a series of variables, maintaining a reference between both 'key' and 'index' values, where the key is linked to the index.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In contrast, arrays are containers that hold variables with no relationship to each other beyond coexisting within the parent array. Both objects and arrays serve common purposes in JavaScript and have unique use cases.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h1>Methods Unique to Objects</h1>
    
    <p>
        Objects in JavaScript have several methods that allow you to manipulate and interact with their properties. Some common methods for objects include:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><code>Object.keys(obj)</code>: Returns an array of an object's own property keys.</li>
        <li><code>Object.values(obj)</code>: Returns an array of an object's own property values.</li>
        <li><code>Object.entries(obj)</code>: Returns an array of an object's own property key-value pairs as arrays.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Methods Unique to Arrays</h1>
    
    <p>
        Arrays, on the other hand, come with their own set of methods tailored for handling ordered collections of data. Some common methods for arrays include:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><code>array.push(item)</code>: Adds an item to the end of an array.</li>
        <li><code>array.pop()</code>: Removes and returns the last item from an array.</li>
        <li><code>array.shift()</code>: Removes and returns the first item from an array.</li>
        <li><code>array.unshift(item)</code>: Adds an item to the beginning of an array.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- <p>Both Javascript arrays and objects can be thought of as containers, both utilising their own methods and operators unique to each element. Objects can be thought of as variables that contain a series of variables which maintain reference between both 'key' and 'index' values, the key being linked to the index. for example  <br>Arrays on the other hand are containers that hold variables that have no relationship to another beyond coexisting inside the container that would be the parent array.

        <!-- Explain what functions are and why they are helpful. -->
        <h3 class="blog-header">Javascript Functions</h3>
        <div class="blog-content">
          <p>
            JavaScript functions are essential pieces of code that empower developers to define actions they want their scripts to perform. They are commonly used to implement conditional statements and manage the control flow of an application.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Functions are isolated blocks of code that remain dormant until they are called or triggered by existing scripts. This might seem counterintuitive at first—writing code that isn't always executed—but it offers a highly customized user experience when running our applications.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To illustrate, think of a function as a button in your kitchen:
        </p>
        
        <h4>Press This Button: Open the Fridge Door</h4>
        <p>
            When you press this button (call the function), it performs a specific action—opening the fridge door. This action is executed only when you want it to be, not every time you enter the kitchen.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Don't Press This Button: Don't Open the Fridge</h4>
        <p>
            On the other hand, when you don't press this button (don't call the function), the fridge remains closed. The code for opening the fridge door doesn't run unless you explicitly trigger it.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>Javascript functions are great bits of code that allow us as developers to write actions we wish for our script to initiate.

        <h3 class="blog-header">An Analogy to Describe JavaScript and Its Relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
        
        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
                JavaScript is fundamentally different from HTML and CSS, but it is essential to highlight the common ground in which they all coexist in the world of web development.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are all processed through the browser DOM, and all are taken into consideration by the browser when displaying a webpage. This is <strong>HUGE</strong>, and the outcomes are marvelous!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Imagine that fridge once again: HTML would be the food—unmistakably food. We cannot consume the fridge itself, and alone without food, what would be the point of a fridge? CSS would be the fridge—it makes food keep, it's palatable when you want to eat it within reason, of course. Nonetheless, CSS is in most cases thought of as an essential part of web development, much like in the case of keeping food cold—one could liken CSS to a fridge to moderate the temperature and keep food fresh.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Ah, and JavaScript. What else is left?</h3>
            
            <p>
                JavaScript is like the hinges that keep the door on. Want an ice dispenser? JavaScript's got you covered. Thirsty? Maybe we also dispense water as well. JavaScript is not essential, but it's darn good to have at our disposal. And when it doesn't cost thousands of dollars like a fancy fridge, wouldn't you be mad not to utilize JavaScript?
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>One for the Road...</h3>
        
        <p>
            To summarize and keep the analogy of our morning breakfast routine going, I want to emphasize the critical role of the DOM and the browser runtime in web development.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Think of the DOM as the intricate machinery inside a state-of-the-art smart fridge that regulates temperature, manages food storage, and produces ice cubes. It continuously updates and runs processes to ensure everything functions smoothly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now, when it comes to the browser runtime, it's like having a highly skilled chef who is always ready to prepare your meals on-demand.

            Imagine you, as the user, walk into the kitchen (the webpage) and request something specific, like wanting a fresh smoothie (interacting with a web element). The chef (browser runtime) immediately goes to work, selecting the best ingredients (JavaScript code) and using various kitchen gadgets (browser features) to prepare your request just the way you like it.

            Unlike static appliances, the browser runtime is responsive and acts upon user input and events on the webpage. It's more like a highly skilled kitchen staff, always ready to create interactive and dynamic web experiences as needed.

            So, while the DOM and the browser runtime may not be as straightforward as conventional appliances, they are the dynamic heart of web development, orchestrating and executing actions that bring web pages to life.

        <h3 class="blog-header">An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
        <div class="blog-content"><p>Javascript is fundamentally different from HTML and CSS- but it is still extremelly important to highlight the common grounds in which they all co-exist in the world of web development. <br>Javascript, HTML, and CSS are all processed through the browser DOM, and all are taken into consideration by the browser when displaying a webpage- this is <strong>HUGE</strong>, and the outcomes are marvelous! Imagine that fridge once again- HTML would be the food, unmistakeably food- we cannot consume the fridge itself, and alone without food what would be the point of a fridge? <br>CSS would be the fridge- it makes food keep, its palatable when you want to eat it within reason of course. But nonetheless CSS is in most cases thought of as an essential part of web-development. and much like in the case of keeping food cold- one could liken CSS to a fridge to moderate the temperature and keep food good. <br><h3>Ah. and Javascript. What else is left?</h3>Javascript is like the hinges that keep the door on. Want an ice Dispenser? Javascript's got you covered. Thirsty? Maybe we also dispense water as well. Javascript is not essential, but its damned good to have at our disposal- and when it doesn't cost thousands of dollars like a fancy fridge- wouldn't you be mad to not utilise javascript?</p>
        
        
<h3>One for the road...</h3>
<p>
    To summarize and keep the analogy of our morning breakfast routine going, I want to emphasize the critical role of the DOM and the browser runtime in web development. Think of the DOM as the intricate machinery inside a state-of-the-art smart fridge that regulates temperature, manages food storage, and produces ice cubes. It continuously updates and runs processes to ensure everything functions smoothly.
    <br><br>
    Now, when it comes to the browser runtime, it's like having a highly skilled chef who is always ready to prepare your meals on-demand.
