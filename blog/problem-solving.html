      <h3 class="blog-header">Blocked on a Simple Problem</h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
        <p>
          One problem I encountered was with the building security system. It
          failed to properly shut down at night, leaving a particular set of
          doors on a campus open. This issue was recurring, happening only at
          night, and the doors were fine during the day.
        </p>
        <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          My approach to solving this problem was to apply problem-solving
          techniques I had learned throughout my career as an electrician. One
          technique that worked well for me was "halving the problem." I tried
          to split the problem in half and figure out if there was any voltage
          at the location where I was standing, or if the door wasn't getting
          any DC voltage to energize the mag lock.
        </p>
        <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          I felt quite confused during this process. Although the problem was
          simple in nature, I didn't have access to the contacts needed to
          diagnose it properly. The equipment was delicate and well-sealed due
          to security concerns, making it challenging to troubleshoot. It took
          me quite some time before I actually stepped back and analyzed the
          full scope of the problem.
        </p>
        <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
        <p>
          In hindsight, I realized that this was a tricky problem with a simple
          solution. The key lesson was that I was so engrossed in the technical
          details that I failed to see the simplicity of the situation. What I
          needed was a second pair of eyes to help me see the solution. This
          experience taught me the importance of broadening my scope when
          problem-solving and seeking assistance when needed.
        </p>
        <h4>How was the problem ultimately resolved?</h4>
        <p>
          Ultimately the issue was resolved after finding a failed backup relay
          for after-hours building security. I had been so fixated on gaining
          access to the door that it took some time before I stepped back and
          analyzed the full scope of the problem. This analysis only occurred
          once I received assistance from a colleague who helped me locate the
          specific relays related to the issue with the particular door I was
          working on. This was so I could initially figure out where in the
          panel the relays for this particular door were located.

      <h3 class="blog-header">Elegantly Solved a Problem</h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
        <p>
          Another particular problem that comes to mind is a time when we were
          working in a pump room. Pump rooms are normally pretty hot, and as you
          walk into a pump room, you generally don't miss the seriously noticed
          heat of the room as a standout feature. However, this particular fault
          was occurring because of a failed pump, and usually with power pumps,
          we would look at the control panel and sensors related to those pumps
          in the system management.
        </p>
        <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          In this particular case, as soon as we walked into the pump room and
          instead of feeling heat, we smelled burning plastic, particularly
          varnish. Varnish is associated with binding to the motor, and
          immediately, this is a telltale sign of the fault that doesn't need to
          be looked at in reference to sensors. This generally has something to
          do with the hardware of the actual physical appliance or unit. Without
          getting my testing equipment and panels, we were able to follow an
          alternative measure of following the fault trail and it led us to a
          burning or burned-out circulating pump in a hot water system.
        </p>
        <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          Throughout this process, it taught me some valuable skills. I did feel
          like it was a relatively underwhelming solution as I do enjoy
          tinkering around and trying to find solutions to problems. In this
          particular case, I learned that I need to stop being too fixated on
          the technical side of a fault and sometimes look at the bigger
          picture. I also realized that recognizing other aspects beyond my
          technical abilities as an electrician were sometimes far more
          necessary. Just being present in a situation gives you a strong
          foundation for solving every problem, as long as you have a methodical
          approach.
        </p>
        <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
        <p>
          In this situation, I learned that sometimes, problem-solving involves
          more than just technical expertise. It's about being present in the
          moment, recognizing telltale signs, and taking a methodical approach
          to troubleshoot. Sometimes, the solution can be elegantly simple, and
          being open to different problem-solving techniques can lead to
          successful outcomes.

        <h3 class="blog-header">Problem-Solving Techniques</h3>
        <div class="blog-content">
          <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
          <p>
            I really like using pseudocode. It seems to me like it's a very easy
            way to put my thoughts in order and allow myself to look at the
            broader picture of things. It helps me apply a logical expression in
            my mind, allowing me to analyze the problem comprehensively and
            create a roadmap of what I need to produce. Pseudocode is not only a
            fault-finding technique but also a way to for me to clear my mind
            and focus exactly on the plan I've laid out for me.
          </p>
          <h4>Trying Something</h4>
          <p>
            I feel a little bit less confident with "trying something". When I
            focus on fixing an issue, especially in coding, where I may not know
            much, I find that I need to research or plan before taking action.
            When code changes constantly it stops me from having a clear idea
            exactly whats going on. For me trying something without a clear plan
            can lead to confusion and jumping around. Developing a clear
            problem-solving approach is essential for me.
          </p>
          <h4>Rubber Ducky Method</h4>
          <p>
            The rubber ducky method is perfect for me. I love it because my mind
            tends to wander quickly, and I get anxious. The rubber ducky method
            is great for my mental health, allowing me to offload concepts and
            thoughts onto paper. I don't use a physical rubber duck; instead, I
            talk into a microphone and articulate what I'm thinking into a text
            document. It's a manageable way to clear my mind, process my
            thoughts, and outline a step-by-step approach to solving problems.
          </p>
          <h4>Reading Error Messages</h4>
          <p>
            Reading error messages is generally manageable for me. However, when
            working with frameworks and libraries, fault diagnostics can be
            challenging. Errors sometimes appear deep within the codebase,
            making them hard to locate. Reading through several paragraphs to
            find the relevant message in the error response can be tedious. I
            prefer straightforward error messages to diagnose issues faster and
            with less clutter to look through.
          </p>
          <h4>Console.logging</h4>
          <p>
            I find console logging to be a versatile way to approach problems.
            It's particularly relevant to my previous job, where I could use it
            to check for feedback at specific points in a function or pipeline.
            However, I must admit that sometimes using console.log makes me feel
            a bit lazy, and it seems like I'm avoiding understanding exactly
            what my code is doing as I substitute understanding or thought with
            dumping a log at a point my code SHOULD be working.
          </p>
          <h4>Googling</h4>
          <p>
            I enjoy Googling and often refer to documentation like MDN docs or
            W3. Most of my learning and fault finding has been related to syntax
            or understanding, MDN and W3 a valuable resource for quick
            solutions.
          </p>
          <h4>Asking Your Peers for Help</h4>
          <p>
            I'm pretty good at asking for help, although I haven't had to do it
            much in the course so far. I believe in seeking assistance when
            needed, especially for more challenging tasks that may come later in
            the course. Asking peers for help is an essential part of the
            learning process, and I'm open to it.
          </p>
          <h4>Asking Coaches for Help</h4>
          <p>
            While I haven't worked with a coach in this course, I've found
            asking those responsible for me for help during my apprenticeship
            was never something I've avoided.
          </p>
          <h4>Improving Your Process with Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            Reflection is similar to the rubber ducky method but more focused. I
            spend time on reflections, examining my learning content, and
            looking for ways to improve. It's a chance to take an honest look at
            my progress, ask questions, and set a direction for my learning
            journey. Reflections provide me with valuable insights and help me
            steer my learning in the right direction. Often when there are
            excercises that I feel haven't benefitted as much at this stage in
            the curriculum. Reflections is my way of holding myself accountable
            for continuous learning.

        Asking for Help and Learning from Past Experiences
      </h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <p>
          In the past, I've had experiences of seeking help, particularly from
          coworkers or leaders who often preferred solve problems using
          workaround solutions if it meant saving time. Often, they would take
          the opportunity to demonstrate how simple a situation was or resolve
          it in a way that I didn't consider appropriate. As a result, I
          hesitated to ask for help, driven by a combination of genuine interest
          and practical considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was rooted in a desire to fully understand and master a concept
          before considering that a workaround was the only solution. While this
          approach aligned with my interest of growth, it sometimes clashed with
          time constraints and business considerations. It wasn't necessarily a
          matter of having a big ego; rather, I genuinely wanted to grasp
          concepts comprehensively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back, I realize that I enjoyed the process of fault-finding,
          and this inclination sometimes led me to prefer solving problems on my
          own. However, I also understand that there's value in seeking help and
          collaborating with others, as it can lead to more efficient and
          effective solutions.
