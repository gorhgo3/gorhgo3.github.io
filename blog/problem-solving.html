      <div class="blog-content">
        <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
        <p>
          I had an issue with the capitalize string part of the sprint. This was
          a little frustrating because I got all the written code correct- but
          missed the slice and concatenation of the rest of the script.
        </p>
        <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          I was in a rush through this section and so I didn't approach it
          methodically - using pseudocode and reading docs carefully. Instead I
          formulated an idea that the method .charAt() was incorrectly used<br />As
          I read I became more frustrated because I was distracted while reading
          and kept thinking I'd missed something- <br />Ultimately I needed to
          employ the log statements to diagnose and break my code into smaller
          bits, and this was when I noticed that I was processing only the first
          character of the word and nothing else.
        </p>
        <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          Because I was distracted throughout this, I ended up getting
          impatient, and this affected my ability to read and process what was
          going on within the script. I also sometimes feel like using log
          statements can make me feel like I'm not understanding what I'm
          writing (even though it's to fault find). It conflicts with my
          learning style of diagnosis, and I feel like I'm cheating myself out
          of a lesson.
        </p>
        <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
        <p>
          In hindsight, I realized that this was a tricky problem with a simple
          solution. The key lesson was that I was so engrossed in the technical
          details that I failed to see the simplicity of the situation.
        </p>

      <h3 class="blog-header">Elegantly Solved a Problem</h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
        <p>
          I was not getting the Green light for the superFizzBuzz - Because
          there were a couple of things going on here I wasn't exactly sure why
          my code wasn't running successfully. The problem was ultimately that I
          was using a reducer function and didn't include the return statement
          for the accumulator after each iteration; this meant that the values
          that were being passed as the accumulator were not the expected list,
          and instead was the initial value.
        </p>
        <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          In this particular case - my initial thought pattern was to follow the
          steps I used to follow when I was an Electrician. <br />
          Half the problem, half it again <br />I used log statements to figure
          out exactly where in the pipeline I was having issues as my I didn't
          initally understand where the issue was. <br />My first step was to
          make sure that the fizzbuzz function that was imported was sending
          through the correct information - this was attained from a log
          statement being called upon each reducer iteration. <br />Then I found
          the issue must have been locally within the handling of the reducer
          because my next log statement was to measure what the accumulator
          value was - and this was how I noticed it was not a full array like I
          expected.
        </p>
        <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          I was in my comfort zone thoughtout this process. I'd performed
          diagnostics like this hundreds of times before in real life - I think
          because it was so similar to my experiences previously it felt
          familiar.
        </p>
        <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
        <p>
          In this situation, my belief that sometimes problem-solving involves
          more than just technical expertise. It's about being present in the
          moment, recognizing telltale signs, and taking a methodical approach
          to troubleshoot. Sometimes, the solution can be elegantly simple, and
          being open to different problem-solving techniques can lead to
          successful outcomes.

        <h3 class="blog-header">Problem-Solving Techniques</h3>
        <div class="blog-content">
          <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
          <p>
            I really like using pseudocode. It seems to me like it's a very easy
            way to put my thoughts in order and allow myself to look at the
            broader picture of things. It helps me apply a logical expression in
            my mind, allowing me to analyze the problem comprehensively and
            create a roadmap of what I need to produce. Pseudocode is not only a
            fault-finding technique but also a way to for me to clear my mind
            and focus exactly on the plan I've laid out for me.
          </p>
          <h4>Trying Something</h4>
          <p>
            I feel a little bit less confident with "trying something". When I
            focus on fixing an issue, especially in coding, where I may not know
            much, I find that I need to research or plan before taking action.
            When code changes constantly it stops me from having a clear idea
            exactly whats going on. For me trying something without a clear plan
            can lead to confusion and jumping around. Developing a clear
            problem-solving approach is essential for me.
          </p>
          <h4>Rubber Ducky Method</h4>
          <p>
            The rubber ducky method is perfect for me. I love it because my mind
            tends to wander quickly, and I get anxious. The rubber ducky method
            is great for my mental health, allowing me to offload concepts and
            thoughts onto paper. I don't use a physical rubber duck; instead, I
            talk into a microphone and articulate what I'm thinking into a text
            document. It's a manageable way to clear my mind, process my
            thoughts, and outline a step-by-step approach to solving problems.
          </p>
          <h4>Reading Error Messages</h4>
          <p>
            Reading error messages is generally manageable for me. However, when
            working with frameworks and libraries, fault diagnostics can be
            challenging. Errors sometimes appear deep within the codebase,
            making them hard to locate. Reading through several paragraphs to
            find the relevant message in the error response can be tedious. I
            prefer straightforward error messages to diagnose issues faster and
            with less clutter to look through.
          </p>
          <h4>Console.logging</h4>
          <p>
            I find console logging to be a versatile way to approach problems.
            It's particularly relevant to my previous job, where I could use it
            to check for feedback at specific points in a function or pipeline.
            However, I must admit that sometimes using console.log makes me feel
            a bit lazy, and it seems like I'm avoiding understanding exactly
            what my code is doing as I substitute understanding or thought with
            dumping a log at a point my code SHOULD be working.
          </p>
          <h4>Googling</h4>
          <p>
            I enjoy Googling and often refer to documentation like MDN docs or
            W3. Most of my learning and fault finding has been related to syntax
            or understanding, MDN and W3 a valuable resource for quick
            solutions.
          </p>
          <h4>Asking Your Peers for Help</h4>
          <p>
            I'm pretty good at asking for help, although I haven't had to do it
            much in the course so far. I believe in seeking assistance when
            needed, especially for more challenging tasks that may come later in
            the course. Asking peers for help is an essential part of the
            learning process, and I'm open to it.
          </p>
          <h4>Asking Coaches for Help</h4>
          <p>
            While I haven't worked with a coach in this course, I've found
            asking those responsible for me for help during my apprenticeship
            was never something I've avoided.
          </p>
          <h4>Improving Your Process with Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            Reflection is similar to the rubber ducky method but more focused. I
            spend time on reflections, examining my learning content, and
            looking for ways to improve. It's a chance to take an honest look at
            my progress, ask questions, and set a direction for my learning
            journey. Reflections provide me with valuable insights and help me
            steer my learning in the right direction. Often when there are
            excercises that I feel haven't benefitted as much at this stage in
            the curriculum. Reflections is my way of holding myself accountable
            for continuous learning.

        Asking for Help and Learning from Past Experiences
      </h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <p>
          In the past, I've had experiences of seeking help, particularly from
          coworkers or leaders who often preferred solve problems using
          workaround solutions if it meant saving time. Often, they would take
          the opportunity to demonstrate how simple a situation was or resolve
          it in a way that I didn't consider appropriate. As a result, I
          hesitated to ask for help, driven by a combination of genuine interest
          and practical considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was rooted in a desire to fully understand and master a concept
          before considering that a workaround was the only solution. While this
          approach aligned with my interest of growth, it sometimes clashed with
          time constraints and business considerations. It wasn't necessarily a
          matter of having a big ego; rather, I genuinely wanted to grasp
          concepts comprehensively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward, I realize the importance of balancing the learning
          and seeking proactive help from others. While I enjoy the process of
          fault-finding, this leads me to disappear down rabbit holes that can
          often become deep pits. While there is alot to be said for self
          directed learning, I also understand that there's value in seeking
          help and collaborating with others, as it can lead to more efficient
          and effective solutions.
