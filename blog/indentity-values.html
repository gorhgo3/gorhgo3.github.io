    <p>
      Growing up in a divided family environment made me self-reliant. My values
      and identity took shape during my teenage years and early career. My
      values were influenced by a workshop culture where humor and camaraderie
      coexisted with competitive comparisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      This environment led to self-criticism and a drive to always improve. Over
      time, I expanded my values to include empathy, breaking free from the idea
      that my worth was tied to productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I maintain a strong work ethic, I also prioritize enjoyment and
      humor in challenging situations. Relatability is essential to me â€“ I aim
      to inspire others by being authentic and doing what's right. This journey
      has transformed me from self-criticism to self-care and positive
      influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      My strengths will serve as pillars of support during my learning journey.
      Despite realizing early in my career that being an electrician wasn't my
      true path, I completed my apprenticeship with unwavering resolve,
      demonstrating determination and persistence. This persistence sets me
      apart and provides a foundation for embracing new challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a background in trades equips me with a distinctive problem-solving
      approach. My expertise in fault-finding and reverse engineering problems
      can translate well into tackling learning obstacles. This analytical
      mindset is a valuable asset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, my recent focus on self-improvement and cultivating empathy
      toward myself is an emerging strength. While not fully developed, this
      self-empathy is a unique aspect I'm keen on nurturing. It helps me
      maintain a positive internal dialogue during times of difficulty,
      fostering patience and self-acceptance throughout the learning process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another strength lies in my ability to connect and communicate effectively
      with others. I naturally create a comfortable atmosphere that eases
      nervousness. This skill has proven beneficial, particularly in
      facilitating interactions when entering new environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to acknowledge my limitations as I embark on my learning
      and career development journey. One of my perceived limitations lies in my
      information processing speed, particularly concerning technical concepts
      in the tech industry. I've noticed instances where I took longer to grasp
      certain ideas compared to my peers, which can be concerning given the
      fast-paced nature of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      This could potentially impact my ability to quickly understand coding and
      programming concepts, which might require more time and effort on my part.
      It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that I might not keep up as
      efficiently as others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, there's a tendency to let these limitations define my
      self-image. If I sense that others perceive me as struggling, it could
      lead to feelings of awkwardness or self-doubt in social interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, I'm cultivating the strength of self-empathy, which allows me to
      challenge these self-imposed limitations. I've realized that these
      perceptions don't necessarily reflect my true potential. I can confront
      these barriers and remind myself that learning curves vary and progress
      isn't always immediate.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I'm mindful of my limitations, I'm also open to the possibility that
      my assumptions could be flawed. I intend to leverage my strengths, seek
      assistance when needed, and maintain a growth-oriented mindset. By
      addressing my limitations constructively, I can approach my learning
      journey with determination and adaptability, ultimately driving my own
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, here's an example of a situation where I encountered resistance
      while trying to work productively with others: In a previous job, I was
      part of a team tasked with implementing a new system involving Building
      Management Systems (BMS). Throughout the project, there were instances
      where resistance and tension emerged due to miscommunication. We initially
      attempted to address these issues through meetings with managers and
      representatives. However, I soon realized that a significant portion of
      the problems could have been resolved earlier through better
      communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, I had managed to establish a good rapport with one of
      the BMS workers who held a managerial role. Recognizing the importance of
      effective communication, I engaged in discussions with him to understand
      the possibilities within the scope of works related to the BMS.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did this with the intention of being able to convey this to my own
      managers to facilitate smoother project handling. This allowed us to
      anticipate potential roadblocks and devise solutions, ultimately proving
      to reduce escalations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflecting on this experience, it became evident that a major source of
      resistance came from the lack of clear communication. When I acted as an
      intermediary, conveying ideas and insights effectively, the process tended
      to be more positive or, if not, we could collaboratively explore
      alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back, I can identify strategies I would now employ. First, I would
      emphasize being proactive during original meetings. Often, not everything
      is discussed in one go, and I would make sure to ask the right questions
      to ensure a comprehensive understanding. Secondly, I'd advocate for a
      greater sense of ownership in voicing concerns, even if I wasn't in a
      managerial position. In hindsight, I recognize that contributing my
      perspective and highlighting potential challenges would have been
      beneficial for the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this experience underscored the importance of communication in
      maintaining productive collaborations. While I managed to navigate the
      situation reasonably well, I've come to appreciate that enhanced
      communication from the outset could have averted some of the resistance
      and tension that arose during the project.
